# ColonyAssessment
This speadsheet can be used to track the state of your colony. It uses two mechanisms to do this:
 1. Ted Hooper's five questions from his [book](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1170899.Guide_to_Bees_and_Honey), probably the bible of beekeeping:
 2. The Colony Assessment Criteria developed by the Galtee bee-breeding group.

## Ted Hooper's five question
Ted Hooper's five questions (REDDS) are:
   * **Room**  Has the colony sufficient room?
   * **Eggs**  Is the queen present and laying?
   * **Development** Is the colony developing as expected? Are there queen cells?
   * **Disease**  Is there any sign of disease?
   * **Stores**   Does the colony have sufficient stores to last until the next inspection?

These are all well described on the [Dave Cushman website](http://www.dave-cushman.net/bee/hoopersfive.html).

## Colony Assessment Criteria
The Colony Assessment Criteria developed by the Galtee bee-breeding group are essentially a measurement of the quality of the queen. Each of the criteria is given a score of 1 to 5, with 5 being good and 1 bad. The headings are:
   * **Docility** Are the bees non-stinging, non-following?
   * **Steadiness**  Do the bees run across the comb?
   * **Brood pattern**  Is the brood patten solid, with few gaps?
   * **Comb build**  Are the bees building comb?

The spreadsheet also calculates how good the queen is, and suggests if you should cull her or breed from her.

## Filling in the form

### Header
   * **Number**   Each queen should have a unique number
   * **Colour**   The year colour she's marked (W=1 or 6, Y=2 or 7, R=3 or 8, G=4 or 9, B=5 or 0)
   * **Hatched**  The date she hatched
   * **Marked**   The date on which she was marked
   * **Clipped**  The date on which she was clipped (or blank if not clipped)
   * **From**  Where she came from, e.g. her mother or a supplier
   * **Apiary**   The location of the hive

### Inspection
   * **Date**  Inspection date
   * **Weather**  The weather when inspected
   * **Room**  If the colony has enough room
   * **Eggs**  If the queen has been seen (Q), eggs ( E), sealed brood (S), unsealed brood (U) , drone brood (D), queen cells (QC)
   * **Development** How many frames of brood? Are there any queen cells?
   * **Disease**  Are the bees healthy? Any chalk brood or other issues?
   * **Stores**   How many stores of honey and pollen

### Queen
   * **Docility** Any stings or are the bees head-butting you?
   * **Steadiness**  Are the bees calm on the comb?
   * **Brood pattern**  You want the nice oval pattern of worker brood with few if any gaps
   * **Comb build**  Are the bees drawing comb?

## Extras
There are also three other parts of this spreadsheet that may be useful.

   * **Apiary**   Use this to record any general actions taken in the apiary, for example removing vegetation.
   * **Q-Rearing**   This can be used as a calendar to manage rearing queens
   * **Treatments**  There are two forms here, one for Ireland and one for the UK. These are the formats suggested by the government departments.
